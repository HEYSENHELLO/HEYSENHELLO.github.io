        <p>Before hiring me, please make sure my skills are fit for you, and your job is fit for me, to avoid complications.
            <b>For instance, I only take commisions</b> <small>(no full-time/part-time)</small> <b>at the moment.</b>
            
        </p>
        <h1>Terms of service</h1>
        <p>
            <small>I copypasted these terms of service from <a target="_blank" href="https://foxxive-portfolio.carrd.co/#tosfaq">another site</a> and made them fit for me ðŸ˜…</small><br>
            <small>Hey, at least I give credit ðŸ¥±</small>
        </p>
        <ul class="tosul">
            <li>
                <b>I AM ONLY OPEN FOR COMMISSIONS AND ONE-TIME PAYMENTS (ONLY ROBUX)</b><br>
                I will not accept a percentage unless the game is already released and earning stable profits. <br>
                In rare exceptions, I may accept a % if the game is not released (Don't count on it)
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>NO REFUNDS</b><br>
                What you purchase will be the final product, if you change your mind, it is no longer my issue.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>YOU CAN RESELL/REDISTRIBUTE</b><br>
                As long as you've paid me the robucks, I don't care about what you do with my work afterwards.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>I WILL NOT WORK ON HUGE THINGS</b><br>
                For instance I won't script a whole game with lots of systems, even with a team. <br>
                Not to be misunderstood, If you need help with bugfixing/small systems in a huge game, I'll be happy to help <br>
                But 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>I WON'T TAKE COMMISIONS THAT I DON'T FEEL LIKE DOING</b><br>
                It probably won't matter how much Robux you offer me, if I don't feel like doing a job, I won't take that job. Plus, there's probably
                people that would do a job that I don't feel like doing for a cheaper price. <br>
                And if I feel like doing it and say yes, I will finish it until the end.<br>
                <small>This next thing should be common sense but: If <b>I</b> applied to <b>your job</b>, that means I already feel like doing that job.</small>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>DO NOT OFFER EXPOSURE "PAYMENT"</b><br>
                unless..., Wait there's no unless, I won't let my intrusive thoughts win, gotta get that bo<small>o</small>buxs ~~ehm, <b>robuxs</b> I meant<br>
                <small>But seriously my <b>Only</b> Payment method is Robux, not "USD", not "TRY", not "Bitcoin", not "Percentage", only Robux.</small>
            </li>
        </ul>
