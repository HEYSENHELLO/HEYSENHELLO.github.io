        <p><b>Did you know:</b> I came up with the name <b>"HeYSeNHeLlO"</b> when I was 9, and it is a pun in Turkish meaning <b>"Hey, You! Hello!"</b>. Silly right?</p>
        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>I am an experienced scripter <small>(16m)</small>, mostly doing solo projects for over 5 years, professionally for over 2 years.</p>
        <p>I started scripting with Scratch when I was going to 5th grade, and then I quickly learned that I could make my own games in Roblox, which was my no.2 favorite
            game at the time (1st place went to Minecraft lol)
        </p>
        <p>So I tried learning scripting but since there weren't that many Turkish resources available, I sometimes got stuck but still found a way to continue since scripting
            had became my passion
        </p>
        <p>
           And for the past 2 years, I've been constantly improving myself with (mostly solo) projects in other skillsets including
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>UI Design</li>
            <li>Thumbnail/Icon design</li>
            <li>Modeling</li>
            <li>Scripting <small>(idk if I had to mention this since I've been yapping about that for 3 paragraphs lol)</small></li>
            <li>Video Editing</li>
            <li>Translation <small>(I put this here in case you want your game to be translated into Turkish, I can definitely help with that)</small></li>
        </ul>
        <h1>PAST WORK</h1>

                        It started from @NightRBX from my Discord Server roleplaying as a scammer, and it got serious somehow lol, it was discontinued for a couple
                        of months because I had IRL stuff like school/home cleaning etc.. But when I returned, me along with a couple of my friends finished up the game
                        to a publishable state in a few weeks. Although it's far from finished.

                        1 year ago, I was hyped to make the "Best Minecraft Game in Roblox". Fast forward to a few months ago, I got demotivated to work on Blunvox
                        and started "Skull Simulator". The difference in thumbnail quality of Blunvox VS. Skull Simulator tells you that how much I have improved
                        in just a few months in terms of Thumbnail Design.
                    </p>
                    <h1>What I've made in Blunvox:</h1>
                    <p>
                        Blunvox was a solo project of mine (meaning I contributed to 100% of the game) procedurally generated by advanced scripts, it doesn't
                        involve anything related to building or modeling, although it involves texturing which were also made by me.
                    </p>
                    <p> Below you can see descriptions to some scripting subcategories in Blunvox:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Terrain Generating:</b> <small>Blunvox uses perlin noise to procedurally generate its terrains</small></li>
                        <li><b>Cave Generation:</b> <small>I used 3D perlin noise to generate the caves, add ores, and much more stuff</small></li>
                        <li><b>Structuring:</b> <small>I don't know what to call this, but getting the structures to spawn in neighboring chunks before the root
                            chunk loads in was... hard, if you tried doing something like that before, you get what I mean.
                        </small></li>
                        <li><b>Raycasting:</b> 
                            <small>Raycasting is an essential part of any Minecraft game, since the terrains are rendered in client-side I couldn't
                                use Roblox's built-in raycast on the server-side, and I spent days creating my own voxel raycasting system which made me gain
                                a lot of experience and knowledge on the topic.
                            </small>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Custom Physics:</b>
                            <small>Instead of using Roblox's default physics, I implemented custom voxel physics (inspired by Minecraft's AABB or "Axis Aligned Bounding Box").
                            </small>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Texturing:</b>
                            <small>I made 18x18 textures for the blocks in the game. Not 16x16 because I wanted to be different lmao
                            </small>
                        </li>

                        More than a year ago: I saw a game called "Obby but you can't see", but it was clickbait so I wanted to make a game that you really
                        can't see, instead, you can kinda "sense" things around you like:

                        Just like Blunvox, "Obby but You're Blind" was a solo project too. I've used raycasting mechanics to cast rays from the player's character and when they hit something,
                        it displays the thing that the Player "senses" using differently colored BillboardGuis. <small>red for killbrick, cyan for normal part, blue for truss etc.</small>
