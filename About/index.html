        <p><b>Did you know:</b> I came up with the name <b>"HeYSeNHeLlO"</b> when I was 9, and it is a pun in Turkish meaning <b>"Hey, You! Hello!"</b>. Silly right?</p>
        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>I am an experienced scripter (16m), mostly doing solo projects for over 5 years, professionally for over 2 years.</p>
        <p>I started scripting with Scratch when I was going to 5th grade, and then I quickly learned that I could make my own games in Roblox, which was my no.2 favorite
            game at the time (1st place went to Minecraft lol)
        </p>
        <p>So I tried learning scripting but since there weren't that many Turkish resources available, I sometimes got stuck but still found a way to continue since scripting
            had became my passion
        </p>
        <p>
           And for the past 2 years, I've been constantly improving myself with (mostly solo) projects in other skillsets including
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>UI Design</li>
            <li>Thumbnail/Icon design</li>
            <li>Modeling</li>
            <li>Scripting <small>(idk if I had to mention this since I've been yapping about that for 3 paragraphs lol)</small></li>
            <li>Video Editing</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>PAST WORK</h1>

                        It started from @NightRBX from my Discord Server roleplaying as a scammer, and it got serious somehow lol, it was discontinued for a couple
                        of months because I had IRL stuff like school/home cleaning etc.. But when I returned, me along with a couple of my friends finished up the game
                        to a publishable state. Right now, that game is almost ready to become a successful game, altough it needs to become more engaging +
                        get more advertisement bobux

                    <p>
                        1 year ago, I was hyped to make the "Best Minecraft Game in Roblox". Fast forward to a few months ago, I got demotivated to work on Blunvox
                        and started "Skull Simulator". The difference in thumbnail quality of Blunvox VS. Skull Simulator tells you that how much I have improved
                        in just a few months in terms of Thumbnail Design.
                    </p>
                    <h1>What I've made in Blunvox:</h1>
                    <p>
                        Blunvox was a solo project of mine (meaning I contributed to 100% of the game) procedurally generated by advanced scripts, it doesn't
                        involve anything related to building or modeling, although it involves texturing which were also made by me.
                    </p>
                    <p> Below you can see descriptions to some scripting subcategories in Blunvox:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Terrain Generating</b> <small>Blunvox uses perlin noise to procedurally generate its terrains</small></li>
                        <li><b>Cave Generation</b> <small>I used 3D perlin noise to generate the caves, add ores, and much more stuff</small></li>
                        <li><b>Raycasting:</b> 
                            <small>Raycasting is an essential part of any Minecraft game, since the terrains are rendered in client-side I couldn't
                                use Roblox's built-in raycast on the server-side, and I spent days creating my own voxel raycasting system which made me gain
                                a lot of experience and knowledge on the topic.
                            </small>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Custom Physics:</b>
                            <small>Instead of using Roblox's default physics, I implemented custom voxel physics (inspired by Minecraft's AABB or "Axis Aligned Bounding Box").
                            </small>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Texturing:</b>
                            <small>I made 18x18 textures for the blocks in the game. Not 16x16 because I wanted to be different lmao
                            </small>

                        More than a year ago, I saw a game called "Obby but you can't see". But it was clickbait so I wanted to make a game that you really
                        can't see, instead, you can kinda "sense" things around you like:
